# Usage

## Photos
Create a `data` folder: this is where all your photos will live.

For each group of photos, create a folder i.e. "sanfrancisco" and add your photos in it.

Finally, create a `info.json` and add it to the folder. This is the format:
```
{
  "name": "San Francisco",
  "date": "2015-01-01",
  "images": [
    {
      "file": "1.jpg",
      "type": "full"
    },
    {
      "file": "2.jpg",
      "type": "row"
    },
    {
      "file": "3.jpg",
      "type": "row"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Test it locally
Install the necessary packages:
```
brew install imagemagick
npm install
```
Then prepare your photos (this can take a while)
```
./scripts/prepare.coffee
```
And finally, compile the app and run it!
```
./scripts/compile.coffee
coffee web.coffee
```
Open (http://localhost:8000/) in your browser.

## Deploy it
For the sake of simplicity, we'll use Heroku.
```
heroku apps:create
git push heroku master
```
Then, you need to upload your photos on a server. Amazon S3 is an option.
Upload the whole `public/data` folder which has been generated by `./scripts/prepare.coffee`.
Tell the app where your photos live:
```
heroku config:set IMAGES_ROOT_PATH="http://example.com/folder/"
```
You can also change the page title:
```
heroku config:set PAGE_TITLE="Michael Villar - Travel Log"
```
